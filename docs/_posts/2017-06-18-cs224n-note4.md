## Dependency Grammar and Dependency Structure

Two main types of structures: **constituency structures** and **dependency structures**.

### Dependency Parsing

Dependency parsing is the task of analyzing the syntactic dependency structure of a given input sentence S. The output of a dependency parser is **a dependency tree** where the words of the input sentence are connected by typed dependency relations

Two subproblems:

- Learning: Given a training set D of sentences annotated with dependency graphs, induce a parsing model M that can be used to parse new sentences.
- Parsing: Given a parsing model M and a sentence S, derive the optimal dependency graph D for S according to M.

### Transition-Based Dependency Parsing

It relies on a state machine.Most transition-based systems do not make use of a formal **grammar**.

- learning: induce a model which can predict the next transition in the state machine based on the transition history

- parsing: construct the optimal sequence of transitions for the input sentence, given the previously induced model.

### Greedy Deterministic Transition-Based Parsing

**States**:

For any sentence $S=w_0w_1...w_n$, a state can be described with a triple $c=(\sigma, \beta, A)$:

1. a stack $\sigma$ of words $w_i$ from S
1. a buffer $\beta$ of words $w_i$ from S
1. a set of dependency arcs A of the form $(w_i, r, w_j)$, where $w_i$, $w_j$ are from S, and r describes a dependency relation.

initial state:$({[w_0]}_{\sigma}, {[w_1,...,w_n]}_{\beta}, \phi)$

terminal state:$(\sigma, []_{\beta}, A)$

**Transitions**:

1. shift:     $\sigma, w_i\mid\beta,A\rightarrow \sigma\mid w_i, \beta,A$
1. left-arc:  $\sigma\mid w_i\mid w_j, \beta,A\rightarrow \sigma\mid w_j, \beta,A\bigcup\{r(w_j, w_i)\}$
1. right-arc: $\sigma\mid w_i\mid w_j, \beta,A\rightarrow \sigma\mid w_i, \beta,A\bigcup\{r(w_i, w_j)\}$

## Neural Machine Translation with Seq2Seq

#### encoder

The encoder network’s job is to read the input sequence to our Seq2Seq model and generate a fixed-dimensional context vector C for the sequence.

1. LSTM or **stacked LSTM**: compress an arbitrary-length sequence into a single fixed-size vector.
1. process the input sequence **in reverse**

#### decoder

1. Initialize the hidden state of our first layer with the context vector from above.
1. pass in a special token to signify the start of output generation.
1. pass that output word into the first layer, and repeat the generation.

#### Bidirectional RNNs

we simply add another cell but feed inputs to it in the opposite direction.

## Attention Mechanism

Attention mechanisms make use of this observation by providing the decoder network with a look at the entire input sequence at every decoding step; the decoder can then decide **what input words are important** at any point in time.

- $h_i$: hidden vectors representing the input sentence.
- $s_i$: hidden vectors representing the output sentence.
- $y_i$: generated word 
- $c_i$: context vector that capture the context from the **original sentence** that is relevant to the time step i of the **decoder**.

$$e_{i,j}=a(s_{i-1},h_j)$$

$$\alpha_{i,j} = \frac{exp(e_{i,j})}{\sum_{k=1}^nexp(e_{i,k})}$$

$$c_i = \sum_{j=1}^n\alpha_{i,j}h_j$$

$$s_i=f(s_{i-1}, y_{i-1}, c_i)$$

scores $\alpha_{i,j}$ at decoding step i signify the words in the source sentence that align with word i in the target.we can use attention scores to build an **alignment table** – a table mapping words in the source to corresponding words in the target sentence.

This model can efficiently translate **long sentences**.

## Sequence model decoders

Another approach to machine translation comes from statistical machine translation. Consider a model that computes the probability $P(\bar{s}\mid s)$ of a translation $\bar{s}$ given the original sentence $s$.we want

$$\bar{s}\ast = argmax_{\bar{s}}(P(\bar{s}\mid s))$$

As the search space can be huge, we need to shrink its size. 

**Beam search**: the idea is to maintain K candidates at each time step.

$$H_t = \{(x_1^1,...,x_t^1),...,(x_1^K,...,x_t^K)\}$$

and compute $H_{t+1}$ by expanding $H_t$ and keeping the best $K$ candidates.

## Evaluation of Machine Translation Systems

### Bilingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU)

Let $p_n$ denote matched n-grams,$w_n=1/2^n$be a geometric weighting for the precision of the n’th gram.Our brevity penalty is defined as

$$\beta=e^{(\min(0,1-\frac{len_{ref}}{len_{MT}}))}$$

where $len_{ref}$ is the length of the reference translation and $len_{MT}$ is the length of the machine translation.

The BLEU score is then defined as

$$BLUE=\beta\prod_{i=1}^kp_n^{w_n}$$

## Dealing with the large output vocabulary

Softmax can be quite expensive to compute with a large vocabulary and its complexity also scales proportionally to the vocabulary size.

### Scaling softmax

1. Noise Contrastive Estimation: randomly sampling K words from negative samples.
1. Hierarchical Softmax

They only save computation during training step.

### Reducing vocabulary

Partitioning the training data into subsets with t unique target words.This concept is very similar to NCE.However, the main difference is that these negative samples are sampled from a biased distribution Q for each subset V' where

$$
Q(y_t) = 
\begin{cases}
\frac{1}{\mid V'\mid},  & \text{if $y_t\in\mid V'\mid$} \\
0, & \text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}
$$

### Handling unknown words

The final prediction is either the word $y_t^w$ chosen by softmax over candidate list, as in previous methods, or $y_t^l$ copied from source text.

## Word and character-based models

It deal with rare or unknown words.

### Word segmentation

Representing rare and unknown words as a sequence of subword units.

One can choose to either build separate vocabularies for training and test sets or build one vocabulary jointly.

### Hybrid NMT

**Word-based Translation as a Backbone**: The core of the hybrid NMT is a deep LSTM encoder-decoder that translates at the word level.

**Source Character-based Representation**: We learn a deep LSTM model over characters of rare words, and use the final hidden state of the LSTM as the representation for the rare word.

**Target Character-level Generation**: The solution is to have a separate deep LSTM that "translates" at the character level given the current word-level state.The system is trained such that whenever the wordlevel NMT produces an $\langle unk\rangle$, the character-level decoder is asked to recover the correct surface form of the unknown target word.
